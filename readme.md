# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Customer Sentiment Analysis & Service Optimization

Welcome to the repository for an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed to analyze customer reviews, uncover sentiment-driven insights, and optimize service delivery. This project leverages machine learning and operational best practices to transform raw customer feedback into actionable strategies for enhancing customer experience and driving business growth.

## Context

### Business Need
In today’s fast-paced and competitive market, understanding customer sentiment and delivering exceptional service are key to retaining customers and boosting revenue. Businesses need real-time, data-driven insights to stay ahead.

### Challenge
Manual analysis of customer feedback—spanning reviews, surveys, and social media—is time-consuming, inconsistent, and unable to scale with the growing volume of data.

### Opportunity
By harnessing machine learning, this project automates sentiment analysis, extracts actionable insights, and enables real-time improvements to customer experience.

### Tech Foundation
An MLOps pipeline ensures seamless integration, deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models, delivering reliability and adaptability to meet evolving business needs.
