# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Customer Sentiment Analysis & Service Optimization

Welcome to the repository for an end-to-end MLOps pipeline designed to analyze customer reviews, uncover sentiment-driven insights, and optimize service delivery. This project leverages machine learning and operational best practices to transform raw customer feedback into actionable strategies for enhancing customer experience and driving business growth.

# Context and Project Objectives

## Context
The project aims to design, develop, and deploy a customer review analysis application using artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, including Topic Modeling , to extract insights on customer satisfaction, sentiment, recurring themes, and trends from reviews. The solution will be deployed in a Kubernetes environment via Minikube and include a data pipeline orchestrated by Apache Airflow. Model and infrastructure monitoring will be ensured using MLFlow, Prometheus, and Grafana.

## Objectives

- **Customer Review Analysis** : Extract actionable insights such as customer satisfaction, emotions (positive, negative, neutral), - **recurring patterns**, and key topics in comments using Topic Modeling .
- **Optimize ML Model Performance** : Track and monitor machine learning model performance in real time.
- **Scalable Infrastructure Deployment** : Use Kubernetes to ensure scalable and resilient deployment.
- **Orchestration and Automation** : Implement data pipeline orchestration and workflow automation using Apache Airflow.
- **Infrastructure and Performance Monitoring** : Monitor model and infrastructure performance in real time using Prometheus and Grafana.

# Project Scope

## 1. Features
The project will include the following key functionalities:

- **Data Collection**:
  Target company for review analysis : Back Market - A global marketplace for refurbished devices.
  Review data will be collected from Trustpilot, a platform for collecting verified customer reviews
  
- **Data processing**:  
  - data cleaning
  - Preprocess textual data by performing tasks like stopword removal, lemmatization, and other text normalization techniques to ensure high-quality input for analysis.

- **Data transformation**:

- **Topic Modeling**:  
  Use machine learning techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) or Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to identify key topics and themes in customer reviews.

- **Visualization Dashboards**:  
  Create interactive dashboards to visualize:
  - Sentiment analysis results.
  - Topic modeling outputs (e.g., topic distributions, word clouds).
  - Model performance metrics.
  - System infrastructure monitoring.

## 2. Technologies Used
The project will leverage the following technologies:

- **Kubernetes (Minikube)**: For containerized deployment of the application.
- **Apache Airflow**: To orchestrate data pipelines and workflows.
- **MLFlow**: For tracking machine learning experiments, managing model versions, and deploying models.
- **Prometheus and Grafana**: For real-time monitoring of system performance and model accuracy.
- **Machine Learning Libraries**:  
  - Scikit-learn, Gensim, spaCy, or Hugging Face Transformers for NLP tasks such as sentiment analysis and topic modeling.
  - Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy for data preprocessing and analysis.
